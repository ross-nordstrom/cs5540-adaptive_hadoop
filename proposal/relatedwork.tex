Hadoop MapReduce is a popular subject of research. The primary focus of the research
is on performance improvement. While the proposals other authors have made vary in
approach and effectiveness, we have not yet found an approach similar to the one
we propose.

Here, we list a few of the other approaches to performance improvement that we have found:
\begin{description}
  \item{Levitated Merge:} Improves the performance of MapReduce by focusing on network latency between workers \cite{LevitatedMerge}.
  \item{SHadoop:} Improves MapReduce performance by optimizing the job and task execution \cite{SHadoop}.
  \item{HJ-Hadoop:} Improves MapReduce performance by optimizing for multi-core machines \cite{HJHadoop}.
  \item{I/O-Intensive Hadoop:} Improves MapReduce performance by using dynamic processing slots for I/O instensive jobs \cite{IOIntensiveHadoop}.
  \item{Hybrid MapReduce:} Improves MapReduce performance by using a combination of virtual and native environments \cite{HybridMR}.
