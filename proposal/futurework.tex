\section{Future Work}
\label{section:futurework}

There is some remaining work to be done to fully qualify our Adaptive Hadoop idea. Additionally, 
assuming our idea holds, there are a number of potential extensions of our work. In section we
describe both sets of future work.

\subsection{Immediate Work}

\subsection{Extension Work}
Another approach to balancing the execution of MapTasks would be to calculate input splits
dynamically instead of creating them all ahead of time. When a slot is open on a \texttt{TaskTracker}, it would
be assigned a task with an input split that gets created with a size appropriate for the current circumstances
and the processing capabilities of the node it will be executed on.
