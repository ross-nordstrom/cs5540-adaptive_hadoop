\section{Future Work}
\label{section:futurework}

There is some remaining work to be done to fully qualify our Adaptive Hadoop idea. Additionally, 
assuming our idea holds, there are a number of potential extensions of our work. In section we
describe both sets of future work.

\subsection{Immediate Work}
To fully vet out our proposal, we still need to assign the modified input splits to a node
of relative size and evaluate the performance difference to standard Hadoop with this change.
Once this is complete, we would setup a test suite to automate performance evaluations as we
develop an algorithm to qualify a node's performance capabilities and map that to a modified
input split size. We would then need to customize the \texttt{JobConf} class to carry
information about nodes (hosts) necessary to determine split sizes and schedule map tasks
appropriately. We envision this information could be as simple as a key-value list tying
a performance multiplier to each node (1x, 2x, 3x), relative to the least performant node.

Another minor thing we'd like to do is improve our 

\subsection{Extension Work}
Another approach to balancing the execution of MapTasks would be to calculate input splits
dynamically instead of creating them all ahead of time. When a slot is open on a \texttt{TaskTracker}, it would
be assigned a task with an input split that gets created with a size appropriate for the current circumstances
and the processing capabilities of the node it will be executed on.
