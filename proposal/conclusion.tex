\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
Our project was a difficult one, simply because building and deploying
Hadoop MapReduce is not trivial. Setting up our environment took up a
significant amount of our time. A benefit of this difficulty is the
extra work we did up front helped us gain a better understanding of
Hadoop.

The work we achieved was, we believe, a solid step towards proving our
hypothesis that modifying input split sizes based on the capabilities
of nodes in the Hadoop environment can optimize performance in heterogeneous
environments.

Our work left off on the cusp of vetting the idea. The major remaining
pieces to be done (described in \ref{section:futurework}) could be done without
significantly more work, and would be enough to validate the idea with
some benchmarking.
