\section{Proposed Design}
\label{section:propeseddesign}

Before doing any implementation, we conducted some investigation into how Hadoop works, 
specifically how it assigns tasks initially and how they are reassigned during runtime.
These are important attributes to understand, because they contribute to uneven effective
workloads in a heterogeneous environment; that is, if two machines are assigned equal-sized
tasks, but one machine is twice as powerful as the other, it was effectively given half as
much work since it will complete it twice as fast as the other machine.

\subsection{MapReduce Task Assignment}
In standard Hadoop MapReduce, the Mapper divides up and distributes tasks to the workers.
